Welcome to the Joola Challenge
===================

**Challenge:** 
- Create a blank webpage with a single line chart showing a single series of visitors during the last day.
- The line chart should show hour by hour (24 last hours) and update in realtime. 
- Data for the chart will be generated by the page itself, so every visit to the page is registered and then shown on the chart.
- You must save the data in a store and the chart must show a query (sum of visits).
